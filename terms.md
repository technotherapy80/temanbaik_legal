Selamat datang. Welcome. This community is a sanctuary built on one simple idea: being a "Teman Baik" (a Good Friend) to one another. To protect this special space, we all share in a promise to communicate with kindness, patience, and empathy.
Here is our promise to each other.
Our Promise to You (The Platform's Commitment)
• We Promise to Keep You Safe: Our team of moderators will work diligently to ensure these guidelines are upheld.
• We Promise to Be Transparent: Our moderation will be fair and compassionate. If we need to remove content, we will do so to protect the safety of the community.
• We Promise You Access to Help: The in-app "Crisis Support" button is always available for immediate, professional help. This community supports, but it does not replace, professional care.
Your Promise to the Community (How to be a "Teman Baik")
By participating, you promise to be a Good Friend to others by embracing these four principles:
1. I Will Listen with Empathy and Without Judgment. We are here to validate, not to fix. The most powerful gift we can give is to listen and understand.
• Do: Offer words of support like, "That sounds incredibly difficult," or "Thank you for trusting us with your story."
• Don't: Judge, criticize, or question someone's feelings. Avoid statements like, "You shouldn't feel that way."
2. I Will Share with Care and Responsibility. Sharing our own story is brave. We do it in a way that is supportive and mindful of others.
• Do: Use "I" statements to share your personal experiences (e.g., "When I was in a similar place, I felt...").
• Don't: Give unsolicited advice. Telling someone what they "should" or "must" do can feel critical. If you have a suggestion, ask first: "Are you open to hearing an idea that helped me?"
3. I Will Protect Our Sanctuary. A good friend protects the spaces where they feel safe. We all share this responsibility.
• Do: Use the "Report" button on any post or comment that violates these guidelines. This is the best way to help our moderators.
• Don't: Share anything from the community (including screenshots) outside of this app. Respect the privacy and confidentiality of every member.
4. I Will Be Patient with Myself and Others. Healing is not a linear process. We are all learning and growing at our own pace.
• Do: Celebrate small victories, both your own and others'.
• Don't: Pressure anyone (including yourself) to feel better or participate more than they are comfortable with.
To Keep Our Sanctuary Safe, The Following Are Not Permitted:
• Hate speech, bullying, or discrimination of any kind.
• Graphic or explicit descriptions of self-harm, suicide, or violence.
• Promotions, spam, or selling of any products or services.
• Asking for or sharing private contact information.
• Impersonating another person.
Violation of these core safety rules will result in immediate content removal and may lead to account suspension to protect the community.
Thank you for being a "Teman Baik". Together, we can build a space of genuine connection and healing.
